# encoder


#ASCII_to_binary(value): takes a 'string' as input, and output an 'array' of bytes (7-bit)</br>
#binary_to_ASCII(binary): takes an 'array' (8-bit) as input, and output a 'string'</br>
#binary_to_base64(binary): takes an 'array' as input, and output a base64 'string'</br>
#binary_to_decimal(binary): take a binary 'string' as input, and output decimal 'integer'</br>
#binary_to_hex(binary): take a binary 'array' as input, and output hex 'string'</br>
#hex_to_binary(value): takes a 'string' as input and output binary 'array'</br>
#no_to_binary(no): takes a decimal 'integer' as input and output binary 'string'</br>
#XOR_operation(b1, b2): takes two binary 'strings' or 'arrays' as input, and output their XOR in a 'string'</br>
#base64_to_binary(binary): takes base64 encoded text and return 6-bit binary</br>
#hamming_distance(b1, b2): takes two binaries as stirng or array and calculate hamming distance between them</br>
#url_decode: takes a url code (not a full url) and decodes it to ASCII characters, can take successive codes</br>
#url_encode: encodes ASCII characters into url codes to be inserted in the url
